# Original IVXP Protocol Reference

This folder is the canonical archive of the original IVXP protocol artifacts that were previously in repository root.

## Structure

- `protocol-docs/`: original protocol markdown docs and test notes
- `reference-code/`: original Python reference implementation

## Notes

- Files were moved from project root into this folder for root-level cleanup and centralized knowledge reference.
- Root `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` remain at repository root for project entry and agent instructions.
